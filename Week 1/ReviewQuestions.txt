31. for (int i = 0; i < 25; i++) {
        array2[i] = array1[i];
    }

32. No.
    The total for the first array would be correct, however the
    total for the second array would be added to the total of the 
    first array. This would give an inaccurrate total for the second array.
    This would be fixed by setting total = 0 before the second for-loop.
